# LiveCollect
LiveCollect is a tool for automated collection of sample dependencies for Ableton Live projects. 

`python3 livecollect.py /path/to/project`

## What is this?
I suck at keeping my sample library in order. Having samples all over the place means I can't move anything from my download folder without stuff exploding. This script collects all samples for a specified project, copies them into the project folder and updates their references in the Ableton als files. It currently only supports Live 11 and 10 projects.

***Note:** I take no responsibility for what this does to your project files*
