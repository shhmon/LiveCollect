# LiveCollect
LiveCollect is a tool for automated collection of sample dependencies for Ableton Live projects. 

`python3 livecollect.py /path/to/project`

## What is this?
If you're like me, then putting samples into your user library while producing is kind of a vibe killer. By omitting this step however, you surrender your ability to move audio files from your download folder without stuff exploding. Also, it is virtually impossible to switch machines if you've got a substantial amount of projects (you'd have to manually open all of them and press "Collect all and save"). LiveCollect was written to address this by copying all external samples to the project folder and updating their references. It currently only supports Live 11 and 10 projects.

***Note:** I take no responsibility for what this does to your project files*

## This project is now a part of [shhmon/jive](https://github.com/shhmon/jive) and wont be updated
